# GetchNet   
A powerful, open-source tool designed for security researchers and penetration testers.
Do note that I do not offer support for this tool, the purpose of this repository is for others to learn.  

This is a refactored project of my previously-paid tool for security researchers, penetration testers, and ethical hackers.  

**How to use?**  
It is easy to compile the project, simply open the solution and run it as Release. Do not trust/download any EXEs!
